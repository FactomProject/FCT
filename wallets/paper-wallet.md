# Paper Wallet



* If you are comfortable with paper wallets, you can make one using [this guide on FactoidPapermill](https://www.factom.com/devs/docs/howto/use-factoidpapermill). By using this option, you wonâ€™t be able to download a traditional printable version of the paper wallet. But this option will allow you to generate private and public factoid addresses which you can write or print onto a piece of paper. FactoidPapermill is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
