### Advanced Factoid transactions

You can use the instructions below if and when it’s required to have more control over your transactions. For example:

* Multiple input/output addresses
* Specify address that pays fee
{% endhint %}

1. Go to settings and check “Enable coin control \(specific or multiple input addresses for new transactions\)”, remember to save the settings.
2. Follow the instruction from "Sending Factoids" up to point 3.
3. The _SEND FACTOIDS_ page presents you with quite a few more options. You can now specify several things such as:
   1. One or more FA address to send from
   2. One or more recipient addresses
   3. The address that pays the fees
   4. Make sure you have enough FCT balance
4. Have a play around with the various options and combinations, use _EDIT TRANSACTION_ to modify or the _X_ at the top right to go back to the transactions list.
5. Double check all details before using _SEND TRANSACTION_, if in doubt you can always try later when sure, transactions in Factom are irreversible.
6. If you choose to send the transaction, the wallet will prompt you with the outcome of the transaction as well as the Transaction ID as shown below.
