# Select Your Factomd Node

By default, Enterprise Wallet will connect to a factomd node run by Factom Inc. This node is used to broadcast and download transactions. This section will guide you through the steps to change which factomd node Enterprise Wallet connects to.

1. Open your wallet, and select "Settings" on the lefthand panel.
2. Ensure "Custom Factomd Location" is selected.
3. Input the address of your new factomd node and click save.
4. Syncing can take a long. Don't worry if your balances are 0 during the sync.

Enterprise Wallet does not download the entire blockchain. It only downloads transactions.
