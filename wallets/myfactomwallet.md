# MyFactomWallet

MyFactomWallet is a client-side interface Factom wallet which can be used online without having to synchronize the Factom blockchain. It provides the user with access to the Factom blockchain, but does **NOT** store, control or have access to ANY user wallet or blockchain information including private key / seed pairs or transaction data. The user is responisble for storing their own keys. Myfactomwallet is the only wallet currently offering support for the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet.
