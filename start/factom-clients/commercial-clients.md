## Harmony Connect

Harmony Connect is a proprietary commercial API that allows you to interact with the Factom blockchain without needing to wrestle with currencies, wallets, or blockchain nodes. Instead, you get easy read and write access to the Factom blockchain. Connect will also track your data's path to immutability and will notify you along the way. These clients will allow you to quickly implement the Factom Protocol in your language of choice.
